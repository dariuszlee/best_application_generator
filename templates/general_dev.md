Dear {hirer},

I am writing to you to apply for the position of data engineer at {company}. I know that I can be a good fit for your team and I will now tell you why.

In my last position, after only a short while and no previous experience in data processing, I left proud knowing that I have increased the performance of the business critical applications, in some cases, by a factor of 4. I achieved this by bringing my Java/C++ background to a Python-based team to implement improved algorithms that maximized existing infrastructure. 

Previous to this, I worked as a back-end hardware/software developer at Ericsson. With no previous experience in hardware development, I have joined a software team numbering in the thousands across Sweden, Canada, and China and successful contributed writing software algorithms that increased the efficiency of cellular networks in cellphone towers worldwide.

I want to highlight that I learn quickly and that I want to be proud of what I can accomplish in my position. I also want to work in new environments that constantly challenge me and this is what excites about the position at {company}.

Yours Sincerely,
Darius
